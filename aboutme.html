    <h2>Colton Pritchett</h2>
    <p>I have been home from my mission to Baltimore, Maryland for almost two months now. Since I was twelve, I have known that I would study computer science and math and that my career would somehow involve both.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life, though I only really started to take it seriously a couple of years ago, and that shift has significantly changed the course of my life. Coming to know who Jesus Christ is, what he has done and is doing for us, and how we can change our lives and those of others, is by far the most important thing that I learned on my mission and probably my entire life.</p>
    <p>Hobbies include math, anything on a computer, piano, and learning. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>
